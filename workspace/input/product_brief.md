# New Financial Product Implementation Template

This template is designed to guide a non-technical team in defining a new financial product and to provide a structured specification for an AI agent to implement the corresponding Go microservice.

## Part 1: Product Definition (For Product Owners/Quants)

Digital Call/Put options is a binary option. For a Call option, client wins full payout if the symbol's exit price is strictly higher than the barrier. For a Put option, client wins full payout if the symbol's exit price is strictly lower than the barrier. Barrier can be defined by the client. The product accepts relative barrier, absolute barrier or null. If relative barrier is provided by the client, the barrier value can be calculated from the symbol's entry price of the contract. Entry price is the next price after contract start time. If barrier is not provided, the product uses the entry price as the barrier.

Client loses the stake if contract expire worthless. Client should be able to request for a single contract price or request for a stream of contract prices. Similarly, client should be able to request for the contract value after the contract is purchase. Client can sell the contract at market value before the contract expiry time.

### 1. Contract Request Parameters for Get & Stream endpoints (Inputs)
*Digital option parameters*
*   **Symbol**: The underlying asset (e.g. USD/JPY, BTC/USD). Required parameter.
*   **Currency**: The payout currency of the contract (e.g., USD, EUR). Required parameter.
*   **Stake**: The premium paid to enter into a contract. Required parameter.
*   **Duration**: A string that consists of duration amount and duration unit (e.g. '1m' is 1 minute, '30s' is 30 seconds, '2h' is 2 hours, '5d' is 5 days and '5t' is 5 ticks). Required parameter.
*   **Barrier**: Relative or absolute barrier. Optional parameter.
    **Start Time**: The start time of the contract. Only required for bid request.
*Pricing time*: Pricing request epoch time. Optional parameter.

### 2. Ask Response
*   **Current Spot**: Spot price of the underlying asset.
*   **Current Spot Time**: Time associated with the spot price.
*   **Payout**: Potential payout.
*   **Ask Price**: Ask price.
*   **Currency**: The contract quoted currency.
*   **Limits**: Contains option specific trading limits.

### 3. Bid Response
*   **Currrent Spot**: Spot price of the underlying asset.
*   **Current Spot Time**: Time associated with the spot price.
*   **Entry Spot**: Entry price of the contract.
*   **Entry Spot Time**: Time associated with the entry price.
*   **Exit Spot**: Exit price of the contract.
*   **Exit Spot Time**: Time associated with the exit price.
*   **Bid Price**: Bid price.
*   **Currency**: The contract quoted currency.
*   **Barrier**: Contract barrier.
*   **Start Time**: Contract start time.
*   **Expiry Time**: Contract end time.
*   **Is Expired**: Boolean to indicate if contract is expired.

### 4. Limits
*   **Max Payout**: Maximum payout per contract.
*   **Min Stake**: Minimum stake/ask price per contract.

### 5. Pricing Logic (The "Ask")
*How do we calculate the proposal before purchase?*
*   **Inputs**: Spot price, Barrier, Duration in years, Payout currency interest rate, Quanto drift, Volatility.
*   **Formula/Logic**:
    *   How are barriers calculated? If barrier is provided, check if it's absolute or relative barrier. Relative barrier is a string with '+' or '-' sign. Relative barrier value can be calculated from symbol's entry price. If barrier is not provided, use entry price as barrier.
    *   How is the potential payout calculated? Use standard black & scholes formula for payout calculation.
    *   Are there limits (Max Payout, Min Stake)? Min stake and max payout should be defined by symbol.
    *   Commission is deducted from potential payout. Commission should be defined by symbol.

### 6. Lifecycle & State Machine (The "Bid" / Active Contract)
*What happens after purchase?*
*   **Start Condition**: The contract starts once it receives an entry price.
*   **Update Frequency**: Contract price should be updated when it receives a new tick or 5 seconds after the previous price update. Update stops after contract expires.
*   **Winning Condition**: For a Call option, client wins when the exit price is strictly higher than the barrier. For a Put option, client wins when the exit price is strictly lower than the barrier.
*   **Losing Condition**: For a Call option, client loses when the exit prcie is lower or equal than the barrier. For a Put option, client loses when the exit price is lower or equal than the barrier.
*   **Expiry Condition**: The contract expires at the expiry time.
*   **Early Exit**: The contract can be sold at market. Contract value can be calculated using the same pricing logic.

## Part 2: Technical Implementation Guide (For AI Agent)

*Use this section to generate the Go service code based on the definitions above.*

### 1. Service Architecture
The service should follow standard go template. Steps to clone template
*   cd /Users/junbon/Project
*   check if go-templates command exists. Delete if exists.
*   git clone git@github.com:junbon-deriv/go-templates.git
*   cd go-templates
*   go install
*   cd ../
*   git clone git@github.com:regentmarkets/service-pricer-digitalcallput.git
*   go-templates --template service --module-path github.com/regentmarkets/service-pricer-digitalcallput --module-name digitalcallput

### 2. Proto Definition

In service-pricer-digitalcallput repository, update protobuf with the following definitions.

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package digitalcallput.v1;

option go_package="github.com/regentmarkets/service-pricer-digitalcallput/api/digitalcallput";

service DigitalcallputService {
  // Request a single contract price (Ask)
  rpc GetAsk (GetAskRequest) returns (GetAskResponse);
  // Stream contract prices (Ask Stream)
  rpc StreamAsk (StreamAskRequest) returns (stream GetAskResponse);
  // Request value of an active contract (Bid/Sell)
  rpc GetBid (GetBidRequest) returns (GetBidResponse);
  // Stream value of an active contract
  rpc StreamBid (StreamBidRequest) returns (stream GetBidResponse);
}

enum ContractType {
  CONTRACT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  CONTRACT_TYPE_CALL = 1;
  CONTRACT_TYPE_PUT = 2;
}

message OptionParameters {
  string symbol = 1;
  ContractType contract_type = 2;
  string currency = 3;
  string duration = 4; // e.g. "1m", "30s", "5t"
  optional string barrier = 5; // Relative (+/-) or absolute. Optional.
  optional int64 start_time = 6; // Required for active contract
  string stake = 7; // Premium paid. Required.
}

message GetAskRequest {
  OptionParameters option_parameters = 1;
  optional int64 pricing_time = 2; // Epoch time
}

message StreamAskRequest {
  OptionParameters option_parameters = 1;
  optional int64 pricing_time = 2;
}

message GetAskResponse {
  string ask_price = 1;
  string currency = 2;
  string current_spot = 3;
  int64 current_spot_time = 4;
  string payout = 5;
  Limits limits = 6;
}

message Limits {
  string max_payout = 1;
  string min_stake = 2;
}

message GetBidRequest {
  OptionParameters option_parameters = 1;
  optional int64 pricing_time = 2;
}

message StreamBidRequest {
  OptionParameters option_parameters = 1;
  optional int64 pricing_time = 2;
}

message GetBidResponse {
  string bid_price = 1;
  bool is_expired = 2;
  string current_spot = 3;
  int64 current_spot_time = 4;
  string entry_spot = 5;
  int64 entry_spot_time = 6;
  string exit_spot = 7;
  int64 exit_spot_time = 8;
  string barrier = 9;
  int64 start_time = 10;
  int64 expiry_time = 11;
  string currency = 12;
}
```
